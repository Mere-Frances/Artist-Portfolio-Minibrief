      Yayoi Kusama is a visionary Japanese artist known for her immersive, 
      polka dot-covered installations and bold, surreal works that explore 
      themes of infinity, mental illness, and the cosmos. Her art spans painting, 
      sculpture, performance, and installation, often blurring the boundaries 
      between the real and the imaginary.<br/>Kusama's distinctive style, 
      characterized by repetitive patterns and vibrant colors, has made 
      her one of the most influential and celebrated contemporary 
      artists of our time. Her work is a testament to the power of 
      art as a form of personal expression and a means of 
      connecting with the world.
